I explained the logic, suggested improvements using defaultdict, and offered help with text generation based on the model."

Overall, Chat is really helpful as a tool to understand code because with real people, it is oftentimes difficult to make time to get explainations becasue everyone has a life and has different schedules. Chat on the other hand is very accessible and convenient to use. "

AI-driven assistance is extremely helpful in terms of learning coding, statistics and data science especially in this course. Before taking this course, I would ocasionally use Chatgpt to help my brainstorm ideas or topics for school projects, but that was the extent of what I did. Now, I am more inclinded to turn to Chat instead of Google to learn because of how quickly and consistently it is able to help me in the first search. "

These skills enable professionals to stay competitive, solve complex problems, and communicate insights effectively. They are critical for career growth in areas like machine learning, AI, and data-driven decision-making.\n",

Going about to learn or polish these skills will greatly increase my chances of working in the field and achieving a high position. However, the suggestions that Chat provided were pretty general and things that I already knew. In this sense, the answered are not personalised to me specifcially as opposed to a human who knows me giving me advice on how to build skills for my future profession, or a professional in the field. The next steps I would take to further the depth of the answers would be to ask chatgpt to \"give me advice on skills I need to build to become successful in pursuing coding as a profession. pretend you are a professional in the field\".
