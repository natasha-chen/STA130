If right tilt = heads and left tilt = tails, we would get 80 heads and 42 tails from the data. The pobability of getting each is 0.5. The p-value is the probability of getting at least 80 heads if we simulated this 124 coin flip 1000 times, which let's say happened 3 times. Then, the p-value would be 3/1000 = 0.0003. This means that there is evry strong evidence against the null hypothesis since 0.0003<= 0.001. So, we reject the null hypothesis, meaning it is very highly plausible that there is a head tilt tendency. "

Then the alternate hypothesis for two-tailed would be that there is a change in either direction, while one-tailed alternate hypothesis would be be that the final scores are greater than or less than (depending on which side) the initial health scores. In one-tailed, p-value will be smaller because there is focus on only one direction of difference.

The sample in this experiment consists of 80 STA130 students out of the population of all STA130 students, 49 of which were able to correctly state which was poured first. Thus, the observed sample has an observed test statistic of a 61.25% rate of getting the correct answer. \n",

    "More formally: The proportion of students who can correctly identify whether tea or milk was poured first is equal to 0.5, indicating that students are guessing and there is no significant difference from random chance.\n",

The observed sample was collected from 80 students and it was observed that 49 were correct.The sample proportion is calculated, which is 61.25%. The p-value is caulcualted with the code below using a one-tailed test which shows the probability of observing a sample proportion at least as extreme as 61.25% under the null hypothesis. The p-value is calculated as 0.0009.  \n",
